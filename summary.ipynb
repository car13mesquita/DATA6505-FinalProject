This may be due to the weather in the evenings typically being nicer in the evening hours whereas the morning hours can still be less comfortable for example in the summer. It could also be because users would not want to exercise before going to work as they may sweat or get their work clothes dirty. This may be less of a concern in the evening which is why ridership is higher then.\n",
