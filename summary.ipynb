        "\n",
        "## Motivation\n",
        "Citi Bike has become one of the most popular transportation services in the urban environment. Not only is it cheaper compared to taxi services such as Uber but also faster and offers a green, health-conscious, and convenient way to travel around the highly-populated city. Citi Bike offers an annual membership which has benefits such as longer free rides. We are going to analyze whether it is worth it for individuals to become annual members. This information can be valuable for both potential members who are considering signing up for a membership, as well as for Citi Bike itself, as understanding the value proposition of their membership offerings can help the company make more informed business decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, an analysis of Citi Bike membership can provide insight into the usage patterns of Citi Bike users, including the most popular stations, and times of day for bike rentals. This information can be used to optimize the Citi Bike network and improve the overall user experience.\n"
